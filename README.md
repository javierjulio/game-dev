# Game Dev Experiments

This is a collection of web game dev experiments. I started off with [ECSY](https://ecsy.io) but have switched to [bitECS](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/bitECS) as the new [Phaser v4](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser) will be using it.

The circle collision math was from the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD-7anXSOp0 with the source at https://github.com/adiman9/pureJSCollisions

## Getting Started

1. Use [Node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/) with `npm install -g yarn`
2. Clone the repository
3. `yarn install`
4. `npm start` (will open in default browser)

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

To build the production bundle and deploy run: `npm run build`.
